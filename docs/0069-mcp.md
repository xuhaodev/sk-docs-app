## Design - Semantic Kernel as Host

### Concept Mapping - Semantic Kernel as (MCP) Host

| [Completion](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/completion/) | Unmapped | MCP's completion refers to completing user input while typing, to automatically suggest the next characters, for example, when typing a Resource URL. This is not a concept we need to support in SK, clients built using SK can implement this. |

| [Prompt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts) | External Prompt Rendering/Function Calling | A prompt is a capability that server developers can create to allow users to more easily use the server; it can include a sentence that's populated with defined parameters, or it can be a set of back-and-forth messages simulating a chat conversation, designed to jumpstart a result. This maps to the rendering step of a PromptTemplate, but the server does the rendering, and SK will consume that rendering. The output is a list of PromptMessages (roughly equivalent to a list of ChatMessageContents), which can then be sent to an LLM to process.
